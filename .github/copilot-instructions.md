# GitHub Copilot Instructions for mq

This file contains instructions for GitHub Copilot for the mq.

## Project Overview

`mq` is a jq-like command-line tool for Markdown processing. Written in Rust, it allows you to easily slice, filter, map, and transform Markdown files.

## Coding Conventions

### Rust Code Conventions

- Always format and validate code using `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`
- Add appropriate documentation comments to all public functions, structs, traits, enums, etc.
- Use the `miette` crate for error handling and provide user-friendly error messages
- Avoid panics whenever possible and return appropriate `Result` types
- Write comprehensive tests and update related tests when adding or changing functionality
