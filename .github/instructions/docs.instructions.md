# Documentation Guidelines

When adding new features, update the documentation.

- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes.
- Use clear, concise language and provide usage examples.
- Document all public APIs, commands, and features.
- Update `/docs` and crate-level `README.md` files for new features or changes.
- Add changelog entries for all user-facing changes.
- Ensure documentation is consistent across all files and crates.
- Use Markdown best practices for formatting and structure.
