- **LLM Workflows**: Efficiently manipulate and process Markdown used in LLM prompts and outputs
- **Documentation Management**: Extract, transform, and organize content across multiple documentation files
- **Content Analysis**: Quickly extract specific sections or patterns from Markdown documents
- **Batch Processing**: Apply consistent transformations across multiple Markdown files

## Features

- **Map and Transform**: Apply transformations to your Markdown content.
- **Command-line Interface**: Simple and intuitive CLI for quick operations.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extendable with custom functions.
- **Built-in support**: Filter and transform content with many built-in functions and selectors.
