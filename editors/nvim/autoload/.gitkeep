# This file is intentionally left empty.
# It's a common practice to use .gitkeep files to ensure that
# otherwise empty directories are tracked by Git.
# This is particularly useful for maintaining a project's
# directory structure, even if some directories don't yet
# contain any functional code or files.
#
# The 'autoload' directory in a Neovim plugin plays a crucial role
# in optimizing plugin loading times. Scripts placed in this
# directory are not loaded when Neovim starts. Instead, functions
# defined within these scripts are loaded on demand, i.e.,
# only when they are explicitly called for the first time.
#
# This is achieved by following a specific naming convention.
# For example, a function `myplugin#myfunction()` would be
# defined in a file named 'autoload/myplugin.vim' or
# 'autoload/myplugin.lua'. When `myplugin#myfunction()` is called,
# Neovim automatically searches for and loads the corresponding file.
#
# This mechanism helps keep Neovim's startup fast, as it avoids
# loading potentially large amounts of plugin code that might not
# be immediately needed. It's a best practice for functions that
# are not essential for the initial setup of the plugin.
