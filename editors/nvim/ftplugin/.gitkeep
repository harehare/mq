# This file is intentionally left empty.
# It's a common practice to use .gitkeep files to ensure that
# otherwise empty directories are tracked by Git.
# This is particularly useful for maintaining a project's
# directory structure, even if some directories don't yet
# contain any functional code or files.
#
# In a Neovim plugin, the 'ftplugin' directory is used for
# filetype-specific plugin scripts. When a file of a
# particular type is opened (e.g., a Python file, a Markdown file),
# Neovim will automatically source the corresponding script
# from this directory.
#
# For example, if you wanted to define specific settings or mappings
# for Python files, you would create a 'python.vim' or
# 'python.lua' file within this 'ftplugin' directory.
# These settings would then only apply when editing Python files,
# keeping your plugin's behavior organized and context-aware.
