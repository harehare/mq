# This file is intentionally left empty.
# It's a common practice to use .gitkeep files to ensure that
# otherwise empty directories are tracked by Git.
# This is particularly useful for maintaining a project's
# directory structure, even if some directories don't yet
# contain any functional code or files.
#
# The 'lua' directory is the standard place to store Lua modules
# for a Neovim plugin. With Neovim's increasing emphasis on Lua
# for configuration and plugin development, this directory is
# essential for organizing Lua code.
#
# Modules placed here can be loaded using Lua's `require` function.
# For example, a file 'lua/myplugin/utils.lua' can be loaded
# by calling `require('myplugin.utils')` from any other Lua
# script in your plugin (or even from Vimscript using `luaeval()`).
#
# This allows for a modular and well-structured codebase,
# making it easier to manage and maintain your plugin, especially
# as it grows in complexity. You can create subdirectories within
# 'lua' to further organize your modules. For instance,
# 'lua/myplugin/ui/' for UI-related modules and
# 'lua/myplugin/core/' for core logic.
