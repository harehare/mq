# This file is intentionally left empty.
# It's a common practice to use .gitkeep files to ensure that
# otherwise empty directories are tracked by Git.
# This is particularly useful for maintaining a project's
# directory structure, even if some directories don't yet
# contain any functional code or files.
#
# In the context of a Neovim plugin, this 'plugin' directory
# is typically used for Vimscript files that are loaded
# automatically when Neovim starts. These files often contain
# global plugin settings, commands, and mappings that are
# not specific to any particular filetype.
#
# As the plugin develops, you might add .vim or .lua files
# here to define the core functionality of your plugin.
